# Arkham Native

The goal is to re-create the [Arkham](https://github.com/oschrenk/arkham) webapp in React-Native. Mostly because Apple is not supporting progressive web apps, especially not the offline capablities in iOS. Instead of complaining, let's learn [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
