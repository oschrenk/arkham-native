# Arkham Native

The goal is to re-create the [Arkham](https://github.com/oschrenk/arkham) webapp in React-Native. Mostly because Apple is not supporting progressive web apps, especially not the offline capablities in iOS. Instead of complaining, let's learn [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Requirements

```
npm install
react-native eject
```

## Running

*Expo*

```
$ npm start
```

*Native*

```
react-native run-ios
```

## Fonts

Created with http://fontello.com/

```
